# Minimalist Spark Project

Take a look at `build.sbt` and `src/main/scala/astraea/spark/SparkExample.scala`.

To open in IntelliJ, go to _File&rarr;New&rarr;Project From Existing Sources..._ and select the `build.sbt` file. Accept the defaults and you should be all set up to run the `SparkExample` class.


For an Spark shell with the dependencies in `build.sbt` included, run `sbt console`.
